# NTU Covid-19 Data Analysis, Prediction & Machine Learning Project (Sep 2022 - Nov 2022)

## Project Overview
This project, conducted from September to November 2022, involves the analysis and prediction of COVID-19 cases in the USA using machine learning. Our team focused on building a prediction model to test a specific thesis and evaluate its accuracy.

## Situation
- **Data Source**: Utilized COVID-19 API data from the USA.
- **Objective**: To analyze and build a predictive model based on a defined thesis, and assess its prediction accuracy.

## Action
- **Data Visualization and Analysis**: Used Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to visualize COVID-19 positive cases based on variables like vaccination doses, symptoms, etc., and observed trends.
- **Data Preparation and Modeling**: Cleaned and explored data, performed training and testing using Random Forest Regression to support our thesis.

## Results
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a 95.72% accuracy rate in predicting COVID-19 positive cases in the USA region.
- **Academic Recognition**: Received an A+ grade for the project.

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Random Forest Regression (Machine Learning)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to access the Jupyter Notebook files.
2. Install Python, Pandas, and other necessary libraries.
3. Run the notebooks to replicate the analysis and modeling process.
